The project has been focuses on the api data and sql db connection.
The main part of the program is undertand is to how the seperate the data from the api like, which loop we need to use for separting the data so the it will more undertanding while inserting the data.

When we try insert data with out seperating it will insert the same as it is there in the api for that we need know how the list works and how we can use forloop in it 

And then db creating we need to create the complete structure how the data has been modelling given and based on that we need to create data modelling.
